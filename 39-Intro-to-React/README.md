# Intro To React

## Challenges With Mod 3 Apps
- manually declaring... everything
  - having to add id and individual attributes to everything
  - manually managing the DOM
- UX information overload
- Wet code
- Performance




## Creating a React App
- `create-react-app <app_name>`
- `npm install`

## Node, Node Package Manager, package.json

## Webpack and Modular JS

## JSX and Babel



## Thinking in Components: class vs. functional

#### functional
 - write a function and returns some JSX
 - props is passed as an argument
 - props.content

 Benefits: is shorter, 'dumber'

#### class
 - write a class that extends React.Component
   - needs to have a render()
     - needs to return some JSX
 - props are an instance property this.props.content

 Benefits: have state (manage data), lifecycle methods


## Default exports and imports
